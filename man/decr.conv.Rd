\title{Specify a Decreasing and Convex Shape-Restriction in a CGAM Formula}

\description{A symbolic routine to define that the response is decreasing and convex in a predictor in a formula argument to cgam.}

\usage{decr.conv(x)}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{A numeric predictor which has the same length as the response vector.}
}

\value{The vector x with a decreasing and convex shape tag.}

\details{
  "decr.conv" returns the vector "x" and imposes on it a shape attribute: "decreasing and convex". According to the value of the vector itself and its shape attribute, the cone edges of the cone generated by the constraint matrix, which constrains the relationship between the response and "x" to be decreasing and convex,  will be made. The cone edges are a set of basis employed in the hinge algorithm. 

  Note that "decr.conv" does not make the corresponding cone edges itself. It sets things up to a subroutine called makedelta in cgam.
